Credit Card starter code
---
This is the starting code for [credit card lab in 67-272](http://67272.cmuis.net/labs/9).  The objective is to create a `CreditCard` class as specified in lab that will pass all the tests given.  This class will be used later in the semester when your application will need to verify credit cards used to render payment.
